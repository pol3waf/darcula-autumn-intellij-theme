# intellij-darcula-autumn

Darcula Autumn is an eye-friendly dark IntelliJ theme which is based on IntelliJ's Darcula theme.

It's trying to hit a balance between being able to identify the syntax by color and not driving you crazy - hence the desaturated colors and rather dark colors for strings and comments.

Furthermore the background has slight brown tint so that less blue light is emitted from the screen while not making the backround pitch black which would be too much contrast for me.

These settings are not science based or anything but just my own preferences. It's basically just IntelliJ's Darcula theme with some altered colors.
