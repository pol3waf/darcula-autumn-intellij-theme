# Darcula Autumn Intellij IDEA Theme

Darcula Autumn is an eye-friendly dark IntelliJ theme which is based on Jetbrains' Darcula theme.

It's trying to hit a balance between being able to identify the syntax by color and not driving you crazy - hence the desaturated colors and rather dark colors for strings and comments.
The background has a slight brown tint so that less blue light is emitted from the screen while not making the backround pitch black which would be too much contrast for me. Furthermore this theme also doesn't clash too much with either dark or light UIs running on other screens. So jumping between windows is not that much of a pain.

These settings are not science based or anything but just my own preferences. It's basically Jetbrains' Darcula theme with added colors.

This theme should work for different Languages and also different Products from Jetbrains.
