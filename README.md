# Darcula Autumn Intellij IDEA Theme

Darcula Autumn is an eye-friendly dark IntelliJ theme which is based on Jetbrains' Darcula theme.

It's trying to strike a balance between syntax highlighting and not driving you crazy - hence the desaturated colors and rather dark colors for strings and comments.
The background has a slight brown tint to reduce blue light while not making it pitch black.

These settings are not science based or anything but just my own preferences. It's basically Jetbrains' Darcula theme with added colors.

This theme should work for different Languages and also different Products from Jetbrains.
